# Analysis of behavioral data from *Drosophila*

This is the code I used for the data analysis and visualization in my master thesis. 
The title of the thesis is:

Optogenetic manipulation of potential candidate neurons for a vibration network
in the ventral nerve cord of male *Drosophila melanogaster*

I analyzed behavioral data in the from of annotated events in audio traces and 
automated animal tracking. Additionally, the connectome was analyzed. 
The analysis was performed with python. Statistical tests were performed in R.
