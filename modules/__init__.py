'''# Custom modules for data analysis and visualization 
The modules aim at analyzing annotated behavioral data and connectome data. The code was
written as part of my master thesis where I performed a neuronal activation screen to find
a neuronal network in the ventral nerve cord of *Drosophila melanogaster* that controls 
substrate-borne vibrations. 

Contents:
    - analysis_utils:       analyze annotated behavioral data
    - connectome_fun:       functions to facilitate working with the *Drosophila* connectome dataset
    - data_handling_utils:  load, extract, copy data 
    - plotting_utils:       functions for plotting and modifying plot appearance
